### Updated Workflow: EVM-Only Buyers and Sellers

#### 1. Seller Lists Tokens
- The seller uses their **EVM wallet** to:
  - Lock **ERC-20 tokens** in the smart contract for sale.
  - Provide their EVM wallet address as part of the listing information.

#### 1.5. Convert ETH to XRP using our pool of XRP currency
- Use our XRP funds to:
  - Check exchange rates using CoinGecko or equivalent
  - Keep buyer / seller funds in our ETH pool, and use our XRP pool to complete transaction
  - Convert ETH to XRP using the real time exchange rate IF our pool is insufficient
    - TODO: research on efficient currency exchange using XRPL built-in deck, but gas fees seem to be incurred when ETH is sent across bridge
    - maybe use this as a backup method if pool runs out

#### 2. Buyer Purchases Tokens
- The buyer/backend pays for the tokens using XRP.
- The bridge detects the payment on XRPL and:
  - Burns the equivalent XRPL tokens to reflect the sale.

#### 3. Convert XRP to ETH
- The bridge converts the buyer's XRP payment into ETH:
  - Uses a decentralized exchange (DEX) or centralized exchange API to perform the conversion.
  - Fetches real-time exchange rates for XRP-to-ETH.
  
#### 4. Transfer ETH to Seller's EVM Wallet
- The bridge sends the converted ETH to the seller's EVM wallet:
  - The seller receives the ETH equivalent of the buyer's XRP payment.
  - The seller's locked ERC-20 tokens remain locked until the payment process is complete.

#### Key Adjustments:
1. **Dynamic Seller Management**:
   - Seller's EVM address is retrieved dynamically based on the token listing ID.

2. **Exchange Rate Calculations**:
   - Real-time XRP-to-ETH rates are fetched during the payment process.

3. **ETH Payments to Sellers**:
   - The bridge directly transfers ETH to the sellerâ€™s EVM wallet after conversion.

#### Advantages of EVM-Only Sellers:
- **Simplified Setup**:
  - Sellers only need an EVM wallet, removing the need for XRP wallets.
- **Transparent Payments**:
  - Sellers are paid in ETH, avoiding cross-chain complexities for them.
